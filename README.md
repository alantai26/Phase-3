# Appli-Tracker

Appli-Tracker is a centralized dashboard designed to organize the job and co-op application process for university students, career coaches, hiring coordinators, and system administrators. Instead of juggling NUWorks, LinkedIn, Handshake, spreadsheets, and trackers, users get one platform where all applications, postings, analytics, performance metrics, and communication tools come together.
